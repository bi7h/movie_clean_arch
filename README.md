This program is built using the Clean Architecture pattern, which is a software design pattern aimed at achieving a complete separation between different parts of the application and ensuring scalability and testability. The program is designed in a way that allows the development of user interfaces and business logic independently from the underlying infrastructure and external components.

Clean Architecture has been employed to achieve a clear separation between different layers in the program. The outer layer (the top-level) includes user interfaces and application logic, the inner layer encompasses use cases and business logic, and the lower layer (the bottom-level) includes storage details and external components.

By utilizing Clean Architecture, the program becomes flexible, maintainable, and testable, as different layers can be replaced or modified without impacting other parts of the application. This pattern also enables the reusability of shared components and focuses on achieving the core functionalities of the application.

On GitHub, you can access the repository of this program to review the source code and find instructions on how to run and contribute to it. I look forward to sharing the program with the community and receiving valuable contributions and feedback.
